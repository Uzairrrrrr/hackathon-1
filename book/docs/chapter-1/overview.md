# Chapter 1: Getting Started

Welcome to the first chapter! This chapter introduces you to the fundamental concepts and tools you'll need.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development is a methodology that prioritizes specifications over code. Instead of diving straight into coding, you:

1. **Define specifications** that describe what you want to build
2. **Create plans** based on those specifications
3. **Generate tasks** from the plans
4. **Implement** using AI assistance

## Why Use This Approach?

### Benefits

- **Clarity**: Clear specifications reduce ambiguity
- **Efficiency**: AI can generate code from well-defined specs
- **Maintainability**: Specs serve as living documentation
- **Collaboration**: Team members understand requirements better

### Traditional vs. Spec-Driven

| Traditional Development | Spec-Driven Development |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Write code first | Write specs first |
| Documentation often outdated | Specs are always current |
| Manual implementation | AI-assisted implementation |
| Code reviews focus on syntax | Reviews focus on intent |
