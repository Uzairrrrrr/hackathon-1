# Welcome to Your AI-Driven Book

This book was created using **Spec-Kit Plus** and **Claude Code** (or GitHub Copilot), demonstrating the power of AI-driven, spec-based development.

## What You'll Learn

In this book, you'll discover:

- How to leverage AI tools for content creation
- Spec-driven development methodology
- Building and deploying documentation with Docusaurus
- Automating deployments to GitHub Pages

## About This Book

This is a demonstration of modern AI-assisted authoring, where:

1. **Specifications drive content**: Using `/sp.specify` commands to define what content should be created
2. **AI assists in writing**: Claude Code or GitHub Copilot helps generate and refine content
3. **Version control**: All content is tracked in Git
4. **Automated deployment**: GitHub Actions automatically publishes updates

## Getting Started

Start reading from [Chapter 1: Getting Started](./chapter-1/overview) to begin your journey!
